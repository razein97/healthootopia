Most people have no signs or symptoms that point exclusively to the presence of cancer in their bodies. However, some cancers occur more frequently in certain age groups and gender. Many signs and symptoms of cancer can be innocuous and can be explained by a harmless health condition as well. But, if symptoms are persistent and do not resolve, it is important to see your doctor and get yourself evaluated.Â Detecting signs and symptoms of cancer can lead to early diagnosis. Cancer when detected early can be potentially curable and lead to better outcomes.

## Some of the common signs and symptoms of cancer for early diagnosis are:

### 1\. A change in bowel movement

Most changes in bowel movement are related to changes in your diet or fluid intake. A stomach bug is also another common cause of change in bowel movement. However, these changes are limited to a few days and with appropriate treatment, bowel movement returns to normal.

Persistent constipation or even continuous diarrhea can point to the presence of a tumor in the colon. Persons with colon cancer may have a feeling of needing to go to the toilet even immediately after having a bowel movement.

Pencil-thin stools are also a symptom of colon cancer.
