Essential oils have been used for centuries to help with different health conditions. Their use as a form of aromatherapy is well-known.

Mystiq Living Deep Sleep Roll On is a blend of 100% therapeutic pure essential oils that is supposed to aid in falling asleep. I enjoy trying out products that are natural and help to enhance my health. I used it for a whole month and this is my experience using it.

**Consistency** - It is a blend of essential oils that include cedarwood, chamomile, geranium, and lavender essential oils. It is oily but very lightweight. It gets absorbed into the skin after a couple of minutes of application. So the risk of staining your clothes or the bed clothes are low.

**Directions of use** - To be applied to the wrists, neck, temple, and the soles of the feet. Inhale the aroma after application.

**Aroma** - It is mainly dominated by the smell of cedarwood oil followed by lavender with a hint of something citrusy (which I am guessing comes from the geranium and chamomile components). It is a pleasant smell and is not too strong which is a plus for those with a sensitive nose.

**Price** - INR 499

**Shelf life** - 36 months from the date of manufacture

**Product Claims**

1.  Helps with insomnia and regulates sleep cycle
2.  Eliminates mental fatigue
3.  Highly effective & non-habit forming

## My experience with Mystiq Living Deep Sleep Roll On

**Does it help with insomnia?**

The aroma is definitely pleasing and helps to provide a calming and soothing effect. It can help with mild cases of insomnia but I donâ€™t think it would make much of a difference in those with chronic insomnia or insomnia due to other causes.

**Does it help with mental stress?**

To a certain extent it does. The aromatherapy provided by the lavender, chamomile, and geranium essential oils is definitely at work here once you apply it.

**How effective is it?**

This is purely subjective based on the individual and what they are using it for. If you are using it for insomnia, it is mildly to moderately effective. For relieving mental stress, it does a good job.

**Is it habit forming?**

It certainly is not habit forming and can be used without worrying about forming a dependency on the product.

## My Final Thoughts

It is a good product that can be a good addition on days that you have trouble falling asleep. Apart from that, it can be used as an aromatherapy aid for a calming effect.
